/*

vuex is a library for state management

local vs global state

local state = state of only 1 component + some children (e.g. user input)
e.g. entered user input, show/hide container

global state = state that is global (throughout the app we use it)
e.g. user auth status, shopping cart items, etc..


why Vuex?

managing global app state is hard
