/*

Props (Parent => Child communication)

props should not be mutated 

data should flow unidirectionally (from parent to child)

we cannot modify the data in child


we can modify this by declaring a child component prop inside data() {} 
and mutating that based on the initial input of the external prop



## Communication from child to parent

-we do this emmiting and event in the child component, to which the parent 
listens to
